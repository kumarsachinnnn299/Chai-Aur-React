# React Roadmap : [Link for documentation](https://react.dev/)
## Why learn react?
* hype,job, trend, build UI
* Helps in easily making complex and easy to manage frontend
## Why react was created?
To solve Phantom or Ghost Message problem (i.e. : appearance of unread message notification even after reading the messsage) due to lack of sync between (state->JS & UI-> DOM) 

Note: Khan Academy and Splash were one of the early times websites that adopted React
## React : Library or Framework?
React is a library of JS and not a framework.

Difference between library and framework: Framework is like military where strict rules are followed like how to name files, how to organize them, etc while library is a cool dude which do not follow a strict rule.

More differences: 

### 1) Library:

* A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used by applications for specific tasks.
* It provides functions and routines that developers can call directly.
* Developers have more control over the flow of the program, and they choose when and how to use the library's functions.
* Libraries don't dictate the overall structure of the application.

### 2) Framework:
* A framework is a more comprehensive set of tools and conventions designed to aid in the development of an entire application or system.
* It provides a structure and dictates how the application should be designed and built.
* Developers use a framework by extending or customizing its code. The framework calls the developer's code, rather than the developer calling the framework.
* Frameworks are more opinionated and often enforce a specific architecture or design pattern.

In summary, while a library provides specific functionalities that developers can use at their discretion, a framework is a more comprehensive tool that provides a structure and imposes a set of rules or conventions for building an entire application. The key distinction lies in the level of control and decision-making given to the developer.
## Topics to learn
* Core React(State or UI manipulation, JSX (i.e HTML in JS))
* Component reusability(Props)
* How to propogate change (Hooks)
## Additional addon to React
* Router (React don't have Router)
* State management (React don't have State management)
* Class based component(not used now, only in legacy code as all react is fucntional based now)
* BAAS (Backend As A Service) like: Appwrite,
## After React
* React is not complete solution in most cases
  * No SEO, browser render of JS, no routing etc
* Frameworks on top of React: NextJS, Gatsby, Remix
